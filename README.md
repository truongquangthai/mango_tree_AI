# This project aims to measure the Total dissolved solids in water. And in order to do that , our
# team use ESP32 and TDS sensor . We also implemented some mode using buttons and displayed
# it on the LCD. For visualization purpose, we made an app to display the current value that had
# been published on the Thingspeak server by ESP32 devices
